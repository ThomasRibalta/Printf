# Goal of Printf

Printf is a project of the 42 school, the aim of this project is to remake the fonction printf of "unistd". We have to make the rules %% %c %s %d %u %i %x %X %p and for the bonus "0 -" and "#+".

# Personal opinion

This project is the must boring x), I say that because for the bonus part we have to check all the possibility with many conditions. Else the subject is really interesting because we see the variatic variable and the arguments not define.

# Result
